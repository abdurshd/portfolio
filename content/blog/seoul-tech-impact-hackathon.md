# Second Place at Seoul Tech Impact Hackathon 2024

## The Event

On September 7-8, 2024, I participated in the Seoul Tech Impact Hackathon, one of Korea's most inclusive tech events. The hackathon brought together nearly 150 participants forming 25 teams, all working towards creating technology solutions for social good. What made this event particularly special was its commitment to diversity, with an impressive gender ratio (66% men, 32% women, and 1% non-binary) that far exceeds typical tech industry standards.

## Our Project: Safe Nest

Our team developed Safe Nest, a web application designed to provide a safe, confidential platform for children to report abuse. We secured second place among 25 competing teams, but more importantly, we created something with the potential for real social impact.

### Key Challenges We Tackled

1. **Data Confidentiality**: Implementing robust security measures to protect sensitive information while maintaining accessibility for children.
2. **Ethical Data Handling**: Carefully considering the moral implications of storing abuse-related data and implementing appropriate safeguards.
3. **Child-Friendly Design**: Creating an interface that feels safe and accessible for children, particularly those in vulnerable situations.

### Technical Implementation

We built Safe Nest as a full-stack application using:
- Frontend: Next.js with NextUI for a responsive, accessible interface
- Backend: Vercel Postgres for secure data management
- AI Integration: OpenAI API for intelligent response handling
- Deployment: Vercel for reliable hosting

### Team Collaboration

Our success was a result of effective collaboration among team members:
- Frontend Development (My role): User interface and experience design
- Backend & System Design: Nicolas Miannay
- Project Setup & Database: Sebin Hong

## Impact and Future Plans

While winning second place was exciting, our team's focus remains on the potential real-world impact of Safe Nest. We're committed to continuing development, with plans to:
- Enhance security features
- Expand language support
- Partner with child protection organizations
- Implement additional user safety features

## Acknowledgments

The hackathon's success was made possible by the dedicated organizers, including Josie Daw, Dagmara Lukanko, Andrey Seas, J.D., and Elim Kalilov. Their commitment to creating an inclusive environment was evident in every aspect of the event, from providing diverse food options to ensuring accessibility for all participants.

## Conclusion

The Seoul Tech Impact Hackathon was more than just a competitionâ€”it was a demonstration of how technology can be harnessed for social good. Our team's success with Safe Nest reinforces the importance of creating solutions that address real societal challenges, and we're excited to continue developing this project to make a lasting impact on child safety.
