Hey there, thanks for dropping by!

**I'm Abdurashid. You may call me Ricky, too**

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a unique background in law and international trade. My journey from legal studies to coding has equipped me with strong analytical skills and a passion for creating impactful digital solutions.

# My Journey
