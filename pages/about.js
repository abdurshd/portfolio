          So, let me tell you my story. Picture this - it's <strong>2015</strong>, and I'm knee-deep in law school books, juggling case studies, statutes, and all sorts of lawyerly jargon. Then out of the blue, we have this <strong>'IT for Lawyers'</strong> class. And get this, we had to code. Yes, you read it right, code! Coding was like <strong>rocket science</strong> to me back then. It was exciting, yet a little terrifying. But you see, law was my jam, so programming took a backseat :/.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
          Fast forward to 2017,  I was doing my law school. One day, I stumbled upon an<strong> <a href='https://kun.uz/uz/news/2017/11/03/sunij-intellekt-londonning-eng-ahsi-uristlarini-ortda-koldirdi'>article</a></strong> that spun my world around. It was about an <strong>AI 'lawyer'</strong> in the UK that apparently <strong>had a better judgment record</strong> than top 100 lawyers of London. Mind blownðŸ¤¯, right?
          Don't forget it was 2017, long before than ChatGPT!
          <br/>
          That little nugget of information tickled my curiosity about all things IT and AI. I found myself gradually drawn into the world of <strong>Python</strong> and dabbling in data science with. Not long earlier, I was knee-deep in web development. And funny enough, I was enjoying it more than I'd ever enjoyed data science. So <strong>I sticked to web development.</strong>
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
          One online course led to another, and soon, I was devouring tutorials, mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, you name it. Meanwhile, I was cutting my teeth on all sorts of web development projects, building awesome websites and web apps. My remotelyâ€”yet practicallyâ€”applied skills were making steady progress, bit by bit, byte by byte (see what I did there?).
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
          Now, I get that it might sound <strong>super clichÃ©</strong>, but the truth? <strong>I genuinely want to leverage the power of programming to do some meaningful stuff.</strong> I want my code to make a difference, to have an impact. You see, for me, this journey from law to web development isn't just about career switches; it's about passion and fulfilment.
          <br/>
          So, that's my story. Just a lawyer-turned-web-developer trying to weave meaningful stories on the World Wide Web canvas, one line of code at a time. Who knew, right?
